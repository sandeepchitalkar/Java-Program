         System: It is a final class defined in the java.lang package.

         println(): As all instances of PrintStream class have a public method println(),
         hence we can invoke the same on out as well. This is an upgraded version of print().
         It prints any argument passed to it and adds a new line to the output.
         We can assume that System.out represents the Standard Output Stream.
